NO OPEN API / HUGGINGFACE - ONLY LOCAL GGML MODELS

# Auto-LLM-Local
Created my own python script similar to AutoGPT where you supply a local llm model like alpaca13b (The main one I use), and the script can access the supplied tools to achieve your objective. Code fully works as far as I can tell. Takes me 5 minutes per chain on my slow laptop.

# Features:<br>
	Langchain Integration<br>
	Llamacpp Model Support<br>
  
# Tools:<br>
    GoogleSearchAPIWrapper<br>
    Requests<br>

P.S. New to python and github, just trying to do my part as I see a lot of people are asking how to do AutoGPT locally without any OpenAPI support.
