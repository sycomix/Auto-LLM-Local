NO OPEN API / HUGGINGFACE - ONLY LOCAL GGML MODELS

# Auto-LLM-Local
Created my own python script similar to AutoGPT where you supply a local llm model like alpaca13b (The main one I use), and the script can access the supplied tools to achieve your objective. Code fully works as far as I can tell. Takes me 5 minutes per chain on my slow laptop.

Features:
  Langchain Integration
  Llamacpp Model Support
  Tools
    GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
    Requests
    Wikipedia
    Human
    
P.S. New to python and github, just trying to do my part as I see a lot of people are asking how to do AutoGPT locally without any OpenAPI support.
